# No-Overtime Policy Implementation

## Overview
The time tracking application now enforces a strict no-overtime policy. All employees are automatically clocked out at closing time and their entries are flagged for admin review.

## Policy Details

### Business Hours & Auto Clock-out Times
- **Monday - Saturday**: 8:00 PM
- **Sunday**: 6:00 PM

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Enforcement**: At closing time, all active employees are automatically clocked out
2. **No Overtime Allowed**: No employee can work past closing time
3. **Admin Review Required**: All auto-clockouts are flagged for admin review
4. **Time Corrections**: Admins can correct clock-out times if employees left early

## Implementation Features

### 1. Automatic Policy Enforcement
- **Function**: `enforceNoOvertimePolicy()` in `/src/lib/auto-clockout.ts`
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/auto-clockout` with action `enforce-no-overtime`
- **Behavior**: Clocks out ALL active employees at exactly closing time

### 2. Admin Interface
- **Location**: Admin Dashboard > Auto Clock-out tab
- **Features**:
  - "Enforce Now" button for immediate policy enforcement
  - Clear policy messaging and instructions
  - Visual indicators for overtime violations

### 3. Review System
- **All auto-clockouts are flagged** with `needsReview: true`
- **Clear messaging** indicates no-overtime policy enforcement
- **Time Corrections** tab shows entries needing review

### 4. Scheduled Enforcement
- **Script**: `/src/scripts/enforce-no-overtime.js`
- **Usage**: Can be scheduled via cron job
- **Cron Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Monday-Saturday at 8:00 PM
  0 20 * * 1-6 /path/to/node /path/to/enforce-no-overtime.js
  
  # Sunday at 6:00 PM
  0 18 * * 0 /path/to/node /path/to/enforce-no-overtime.js
  ```

## User Experience

### For Employees
- Cannot work past closing time
- Will be automatically clocked out at closing
- Should manually clock out before closing time

### For Admins
- All auto-clockouts appear in "Time Corrections" tab
- Can review and adjust times if employees left early
- Clear visibility into policy enforcement
- Manual "Enforce Now" button for immediate enforcement

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Enhanced `autoClockOutReason` with no-overtime messaging
- All auto-clockouts flagged with `needsReview: true`
- Improved logging and audit trails

### API Enhancements
- New `enforce-no-overtime` action in auto-clockout API
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Transaction safety for bulk operations

### Frontend Updates
- Policy messaging throughout admin interface
- "Enforce Now" button in auto-clockout management
- Updated instructions and help text

## Benefits

1. **Cost Control**: Eliminates unexpected overtime costs
2. **Policy Compliance**: Ensures consistent work hour enforcement
3. **Admin Oversight**: Provides review mechanism for accuracy
4. **Transparency**: Clear messaging about policy enforcement
5. **Automation**: Reduces manual oversight burden

## Configuration

The policy is currently hardcoded to business hours but can be easily modified in:
- `/src/lib/auto-clockout.ts` - `BUSINESS_HOURS` constant
- Closing times: 8 PM (Mon-Sat), 6 PM (Sunday)

## Monitoring

Check the application logs for enforcement activities:
- Auto-clockout operations are logged with timestamps
- Employee counts and names are recorded
- Error conditions are clearly identified
